### Engineering Project

#### Build a Simple Messenger Application
We'd like you to build a very simple messenger web app that performs a specific set of functionality
in a desktop browser or mobile browser.

#### Messenger Application High Level Requirements
An application that allows two users to send short text messages to each other, like Facebook
Messages app or Google Chat.
- It's possible to type a short message and have it sent to another user
- It's possible to see messages sent from another user appear reasonably soon after they were sent

#### Other Considerations
For each idea here are some additional considerations to help you decide what and how much to
build:
- This should be extremely basic, certainly more so than the example apps above
- We're only expecting a few hours to a half day of effort, though you're free to spend more if inspired
- Any functionality beyond the core features above is strictly optional but we'd be lying to say we're not impressed by something really cool you sneak in, whether it's from existing apps or your own idea entirely
- Don't spend much if any time on accounts, users, or registration; it's perfectly fine to have one or two "hardcoded" accounts that simply work with each other
- Don't spend much if any time on graphics or visual appeal; we are looking at functionality, testing, coding style, and design decisions more than appearance
- It will likely need some type of services and storage but what this is remains entirely up to you: it can use a rudimentary server, third-party/existing services, or anything else that gets the job done as long as you can explain why you picked it
- It can be very hacked together and have bugs; we don't expect anything close to release quality and in fact we'd love to hear what went wrong and what you'd do differently on a second attempt, but you'll impress us more if you know these limitations versus "discover" them with us during the demo

#### Ground Rules
We'd also like to set some ground rules to keep this as fair as possible:
- This should be original code rather than something you've written previously, borrowed from a friend, or found on the internet, though incorporating open source or third-party code is fine as long as it's clearly distinguishable from original code
- This should be done by yourself, meaning you can use all of the example code, docs, and resources of the internet but understand we'll pour over it thoroughly for both style and content and you really don't want to be caught not being able explain something you've just claimed to have written!

#### Other Caveats
And finally, don't sweat this too much! Here are a few other things to keep in mind:
- If you get really stuck and don't feel like you can finish this in a short amount of time (or at all), that's fine; just build what you can and supplement it with a detailed written description/design on where things ended up, where you would go next with more time, and be ready to talk about it
- At any point if you'd like help or feedback with something you're stuck on feel free to reach out to me by email (pretend I'm another experienced engineer on your team but not on the same project); how much help you want is up to you, and while asking questions is not viewed negatively we love seeing how much you can accomplish by yourself even if it's not ideal since we all do a lot of self- directed learning at a startup!
#### Evaluation
- Final code project in a ready to build/run state along with instructions, notes, and any related documentation should be checked into a public GitHub project with the link emailed to me for our team to review
- We may or may not use in-office interview time to discuss your solution, so assume that we won't and that what you've included may be the only explanation seen by multiple technical people on our team
- Creativity, clarity, design decisions, understanding the challenges of the problem, and being able to extrapolate further if/when we discuss it are more important than the volume of code written
